        <h2>Many would say Makaronilaatikko is the same as nistipata. WRONG!</h2>
        <p>You're not making Makaronilaatikko because it's all you can afford, You're making it because you want to</p>
        <p>It's a lifestyle at this point. You're either a working man (r√∂imies) or a mother who claims that home made food is always the healthier option, yet have the decency to feed her kids a mixture of cheap ass pasta and ground beef and call it a day</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>milk or cream</li>
            <li>an egg or 2</li>
            <li>cheesy if you're feeling fancy</li>
            <li>ketchup for garnish, to get the gourmet experience</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set the oven to 175 celcius</li>
            <li>Chop up those onions, or just get those frozen packets of diced onions.
                not only are they cheaper, lets face it... you're making this dish because you're lazy
                so why not go all the way.
            </li>
            <li>Mix everything (besides the cheese and ketchup) together</li>
            <li>Dump that mixture into a dish</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cheese on top</li>
            <li>Put it in the oven for like,idk... 45 min? Yeah sounds about right...</li>
            <li>get yourself a glass of wine while you wait because you "had a long day and you deserve it".
                lets face it though... You have an alcohol problem and your family knows about it. It's getting awkward...    
            </li>
            <li>We forgot to add spices but its fine. just squirt half a bottle of ketchup on top and call it a day.</li>
        </ol>
