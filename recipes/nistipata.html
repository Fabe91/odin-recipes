    <h2>What is nistipata?</h2>
    <p>Nistipata is a traditional Finnish delicacy popular mostly mostly amongst students, "artists" and well... crackheads. </p>
    <p>Nistipata is often rebranded as makaronilaatikko, but the rule of thumb is that if you can't afford the luxury of buying ketchup for this lovely dish then face it, you're broke and it's just good old nistipata, mene t√∂ihin.
    </p>
    <p>Makaronilaatikko is what it's usually called by lazy parents who cant bother making nutritious food for their future nistipata consuming nisti-kids.</p>
